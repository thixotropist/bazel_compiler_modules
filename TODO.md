# To do list

* [ ] Research the inclusion of `liblto_plugin.so` and `libcp1plugin.so.0.0.0` in `scripts/gcc_x86_64.py`,
      especially within an out of date GCC 15.0.1 versioned directory.  Do we really need these?
* [ ] Compare `cc_toolchain_config.bzl` with the current native `cc_toolchain_config.bzl` to see if we should rebase
      the toolchain configuration.
